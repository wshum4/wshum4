### Hi there 👋🏻 I'm Wince!

I am an ex-aviation professional and private jet charter broker that decided to take a leap of faith and switch careers in tech. I just recently completed a 9-week full stack web development bootcamp with [Le Wagon Montreal](https://www.lewagon.com/montreal). I've relocated back to Canada after living abroad for 9 years and have completed my MBA at [The University of Bath](https://mba.bath.ac.uk/). When not coding away, you can often find me in the kitchen baking 🥖 and cooking 🍳 away. I am a passionate dog 🐶 lover, amateur plant parent 🌿 and a rugby fanatic 🏉.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal project with a friend on sustainable and eco shopping.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently learning and improving on my JavaScript skills. I want to look into React once I am done.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, aviation, jets, my travel journeys, why I ended up in coding
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/winceshum), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wshum_) (Be warned: I rarely use this though!)
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I accidentally moved home back to Canada, reason behind this is COVID 😯
